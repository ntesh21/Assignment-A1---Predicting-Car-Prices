# Car Price Prediction

## This webapp helps in predicting the price of the car from the attributes of the car provides by the users.

####  The prediction is done using the Machine Learning method. Linear Regression model which is trained using the car price dataset is used to predict the price of the car give the certain parameters from the users.The model takes cars features such as engine, max power, year made and predicts the most likely price of the car with those very features. 

##### Car's features to be entered are:
- Year Made
- Mileage(cc)
- Engine Capacity(hp)
- Max Power

##### Regression Mode Used:
- RandomForest Regressor



### Assignment 2

##### Task 1
##### Function to compute R2

### Linear Regression Class

##### Changes made from original class 

- Added method to initialze weight (zero , Xavier) ==> "initialize"
- Added method to calculate the  gradients with or without momentum ==> apply_momentum
- Added method to plot the features according to their co_efficients ==> plot_feature_importance
